  What I&rsquo;m offering
</h2>
<p>
  I&rsquo;m setting aside time on Fridays if you want someone to bounce ideas off of. We can talk about any topic you like, but here&rsquo;s some subjects I think I might specifically be able to help you out with:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Design and design tools</li>
  <li>User testing and user experience</li>
  <li>Accessibility</li>
  <li>Semantics</li>
  <li><abbr>CSS</abbr> and <a href="http://sass-lang.com/"><abbr>Sass</abbr></a></li>
</ul>
<p>
  Worse comes to worse, I&rsquo;m an excellent <a href="https://rubberduckdebugging.com/">rubber duck</a>.

<h2
  id="subtitle-what-im-not-offering"
  class="heading-beta">
  What I&rsquo;m not offering
</h2>
<p>
  Just to make sure our expectations are aligned: I will not be giving out job or internship offers, or legally binding advice for things like accessibility remediation. I will also not do your work for you, but I will happily help you work through it and point you to relevant resources!
</p>
<p>
  I will hang up on you if you try to sell me something.
</p>

<h2
  id="subtitle-who-id-like-to-hear-from"
  class="heading-beta">
  Who I&rsquo;d like to hear from
</h2>
<p>
  Anyone of any skill level! This kind of things can seem intimidating, but I'd like to help if I can. If it turns out you know more than me, I&rsquo;d love the opportunity to learn from you.
</p>
<p>
  I&rsquo;d especially like to hear from you if you identify with a group that is underrepresented in technology.

  How to set up a meeting

  <a rel="external me noopener" data-message-subject="Office hours" href="mailto:&#101;&#114;&#105;&#099;&#046;&#119;&#046;&#098;&#097;&#105;&#108;&#101;&#121;☛REMOVE-THIS☚&#064;&#103;&#109;&#097;&#105;&#108;&#046;&#099;&#111;&#109;">Send me an email</a> and we can schedule a time to meet. I like <a href="https://hangouts.google.com/">Google Hangouts</a>, but I'm happy to use another service if it is more convenient for you.
</p>
<p>
  For scheduling purposes, I work out of an <a href="https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/converter.html?iso=20181026T170000&p1=tz_et">Eastern United States time zone</a>, typically from <time datetime="09:00">9</time> to <time datetime="17:00">5</time>. Meetings will last about 15&#x2012;30 minutes.
