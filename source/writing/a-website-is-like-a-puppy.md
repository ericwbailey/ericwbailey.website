- It’s exciting and fun, but also comes with a lot of responsibility.
- Successfully taking care of it means you’ll need to stick to a routine.
- It can bring you moments of both great joy and sorrow.
- It costs a little more than you think it will.
- It will also probably grow to be a little bigger than you first thought.
- Every once in awhile it will shit on the floor at three in the morning, and there’s nothing you can do to prevent it.
