excerpt: "At the end of the year, thoughtbot sets aside two days for a hackathon called Ralphapalooza. The name is a portmanteau of Ralph, the robot we use for our logo, and the term palooza. During Ralphapalooza, we pitch ideas, form teams, and create something interesting with our fellow thoughtbotters"
