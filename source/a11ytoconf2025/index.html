            <ul>
              <li>Hi there, Accessibility Toronto. My name is Eric, and I’m a senior accessibility designer by trade. I’m a tall White man with black hair and beard, who is wearing trendy glasses with clear frames. My pronouns are he/him.</li>
              <li>A copy of this talk can be accessed by using the QR code shown on screen, or by going to eric w bailey dot website forward slash a 1 1 y t o c o n f 2 0 2 5.</li>
              <li>The images used on these slides are predominately thematic, and the slide’s spoken content addresses these themes. If not, the images will be specifically called out.</li>
              <li>Additionally, this talk will use high contrast color values to drive the overall tone and mood. You can avoid the screen and listen along, or use a button to toggle the images off or desaturate them on the copy of the talk I link to.</li>

            <h3>Slide 2</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>As a content warning, this talk will discuss substance abuse, compulsive behavior, depression, and self harm. It is also centered around discussing trauma and how it affects our industry.</li>
              <li>Here, I would like to point out that the act of discussing trauma itself can bring about negative emotions and reactions. I know that content warnings are more commonplace in inclusivity spaces, and in the same breath I want to seriously re-stress that the placement of this content warning is highly intentional. We will be directly covering some incredibly heavy concepts.</li>

              <li>With that established, I’d like to now introduce this talk:</li>
              <li>It is called “It is designed to break your heart” and it is about cultivating a harm reduction mindset as an accessibility practitioner.</li>

            <h3>Slide 4</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>There are two truths here, held in two fists. This metaphor was taught to me by my friend and coworker Alexis Lucio. It was in turn taught to them by Lisa Olivera, their therapist.</li>
              <li>The first truth is that I really like my job, and that I think I’m uniquely suited for it. Our work is supported, and my peers are great people doing good work. I’m grateful for the deep level of fulfillment I get from performing this labor, and it is some of the most impactful work I’ve done in my entire career.</li>
              <li>The second truth is that I also struggle with this job. The very nature of accessibility work takes a toll. This is even in an environment that is, by my estimation, one of the best in the entire industry.</li>

            <h3>Slide 8</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>With that established, I’d like to talk about 2023. It was… a lot.</li>
              <li>Covid continued to rage and with that comes the isolation quarantine brings. There were multiple platform deaths and community collapses, both offline and on. I continued to be disconnected from many friends and loved ones.</li>
              <li>Political instability was showing up both internationally and domestically, and all I could do was read about it with waking horror.</li>
              <li>Layoffs were sweeping the tech industry and my employer was no exception. Entire teams would be disappeared overnight, and I was left wondering if we’d be next. </li>
              <li>This fed a deep insecurity that I’ve carried with me since childhood. My father was laid off, fell behind the curve of tech, and was never able to successfully re-enter the job market.</li>
              <li>I was abusing alcohol as a coping mechanism for all of this. This created a feedback loop that was amplified by my already existing anxiety and chronic insomnia.</li>
              <li>I’ve danced with depression my entire life, and it deepened to the point where multiple panic attacks struck, as well as manifesting intrusive thoughts and dissociative events so strong that I lost time. My marriage also suffered, and that’s something we’re still actively working to repair.</li>
              <li>I also started taking a deep look at what makes me tick, revealing Aphantasia, Dyspraxia, Severely Deficient Autobiographical Memory, and Alexithymia. All of these are strong indicators of neurodivergency and autism, which is something I’m still trying to get to the bottom of.</li>
              <li>So, it was also a very personal reintroduction to the disability community, and my identity within it.</li>

            <h3>Slide 9</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>I fell apart on on September 8th, 2023. </li>
              <li>I was admitted to the ER with a blood sugar level in the 400s, a triglyceride count that was twelve times higher than the normal range, and a blood pressure measurement that was labeled as a hypertensive crisis.</li>
              <li>The reason I’m alive and giving this talk today is sheer lucky coincidence, but my emotional state at the time was so depressed and dissociative that the severity of the day completely did not register. </li>

              <li>I say these things not to trauma dump, or to elicit pity. Instead, as a person in our industry who is notable for the content they produce, I want to let you in. Please know that I’m also a human, with all the joy and sorrow that comes with it.</li>
              <li>The struggles I’ve experienced are not evident in the material I normally share, and I’m not sure if that’s healthy. Because of this, I believe that sharing this vulnerability helps to serve as a framing device for the rest of this talk, and open the doors to things I think we’re all hesitant to discuss.</li>
              <li>So, why do I feel this way? And how can I make sure I never feel this way again? I won’t lie: it all started as a selfish impulse to avoid feeling this pain again at all costs. Because I am the way I am, I started to research.</li>

              <li>In late 2023, I interviewed 20 accessibility specialists to learn about their work and burnout experiences. <strong>Every single one was in burnout or burnout recovery, or was actively avoiding burnout using skills they learned from previous bouts of work burnout</strong>.</li>

            <h3>Slide 27</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>To start, there is weaponized professionalism. This occurs when stakeholders take advantage of the empathetic nature of care-oriented roles to guilt people into taking on more responsibilities and performing past their limits. A common form of this is being set up as “the voice of the user” with zero additional resources or clout, and then being expected to go to the mat for each and every instance where human considerations are deprioritized.</li>
              <li>Organized abandonment forces individuals to figure out how to navigate systemic failure to manage their own needs. This is a concept brought to us by Ruth Wilson Gilmore, professor, abolitionist, and Director of the Center for Place, Culture, and Politics. Of note here is that abandonment is not evenly distributed, and typically most adversely affects services, resources, and people who are perceived as indirectly contributing towards capital.</li>
              <li>Psychologist, researcher, author, educator, and speaker Jennifer Freyd teaches us that institutional betrayal is what happens when an institution causes harm to an individual who trusts or depends on it. Here, I would like to call attention to many organization’s public commitments to accessibility and inclusion, the people who are sacrificed in trying to make those commitments happen, and then the institution’s private machinations to subvert, suppress, and walk back said commitments. Specifically, this betrayal happens as a mechanical output of a system. Things like personal improvement plans, demotions, team reassignments, and weighted stack rankings are all artifacts generated when the gears of the machine grind to produce hypocrisy.</li>
              <li>A sibling of institutional betrayal is moral injury. This is what manifests when an organization’s actions contradict its stated mission, or the mission of one of its teams—say an accessibility team. In fact, moral injury can be a fractal of hurt. Contradictions can in turn be contradicted, especially in large, hierarchical, and siloed organizations. Accessibility professionals often work laterally and holistically across an organization and can consequently see more of its surface area. Therefore, there are more perceived hypocrisies, perhaps far more than a peer consigned to a single silo. And, to cut to the heart of it: Moral injury can actually harm your sense of self, your ability to trust, and your deeply held beliefs—even if you don’t consider work to be a large part of your identity. With this harm comes an even more insidious phenomenon: Shame and guilt that lead to maladaptive coping responses including feeling like you are a failure or a burden to those around you.</li>

We often talk about the state of the state of the industry, and his quote struck me enough that I asked him if I could share it.</li>
              <li>The quote from him reads: “We’re doing the work that, in any other field, regulators would be seeing to. We do it with none of the authority. So we also end up having to be social workers, professional advocates, educators, and so many other things. Endquote.</li>
              <li>This is Jan’s observation, but also not an isolated one. It’s a common enough sentiment that it’s openly discussed in multiple spaces I’m present in. But what really stood out to me was his use of the term “social worker.”</li>

            <ul>
              <li>So now, let’s talk about connecting threads. I’ve been a member of a trauma-informed group for a few years now.</li>
              <li>If you’re not familiar, trauma-informed work is the practice of addressing how our environment can affect us negatively, and then using this knowledge to attempt to reduce or remove the harm. It’s a radical idea, in that it <strong>acknowledges harm as a material to work with</strong>.</li>
              <li>The group is a wonderful mix of researchers, academics, designers, caregivers, and yes, social workers who share knowledge and news, ask questions, and generally strive to move the space forward.</li>
              <li>I joined this group after performing some user research with a population I was woefully unequipped to deal with in a safe manner. I realized that I needed to address this shortcoming in order to approach my job in a considered and ethical way. One that did not put more harm out into the world in the pursuit of cold, impersonal research insights.</li>
              <li>The larger point being here that in this group I was exposed to vital concepts that sit outside of the normal scope of traditional design, development, and digital accessibility practices.</li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
              <li>This, in turn, brings up something that I need to directly address here: The vast majority of the content of my talk is attributed to, or is built from knowledge that sits outside of what I think of as the traditional technology sphere.</li>
              <li>This is not new information, nor am I its creator. This knowledge is the product of literal decades of tireless work from activist individuals and groups striving to address deep inadequacies and structural harms visited on us by establishment majorities.</li>
              <li>I am using my privilege and position as a White cisgender man to consciously and deliberately take advantage of the reach that Accessibility Toronto provides. I am not the expert, and know that there are very real, very human consequences to doing trauma-informed work. Instead, the idea here is that I am trying to elevate these ideas and broaden their reach. </li>
              <li>Additionally, I hope to shed light on the people behind these ideas, and in doing so help create a healthier way of thinking about, and approaching the work we do.</li>

              <li>A lot of this knowledge comes from marginalized, minoritized, and discriminated individuals that did this work, notably from QTBIPOC populations. I deliberately and specifically want to avoid erasure here, and I hope you’ll help keep me honest in doing so.</li>
              <li>Also note that a lot of these voices have been lost to time due to how society has failed them. So know that sometimes when it feels like someone should be named for their ideas, that information has literally been scrubbed by forces that indirectly and directly pushed them out.</li>
              <li>Another thing I am hyper-cognizant of is how the tech space in particular defaults to a savior attitude. This is something I think people in Disability Justice spaces are already painfully aware of, but may be a concept newer to those in the digital accessibility space.</li>
              <li>With saviorism comes centering the wrong person, but also a far more subtle and sinister output: Extraction.</li>
              <li>While I <strong>do</strong> encourage you to explore this space, I also want to stress that when we cease to see individuals as people and instead as data points, we discard their humanity in the search to help productitize lived, and oftentimes traumatic experiences.</li>

              <li>We’ve already established that burnout is one of many things that can be caused by trauma, but now we need to dive into the concept on a deeper level to better understand it. As a base working definition, trauma is “an emotional, cognitive, or physical response to a terrible acute, complex, or historical event.”
              <li>What I want to spend time on here is discussing trauma not as an abstract concept, but as a concrete thing. A thing that that has been exhaustively researched and worked on from multiple people from multiple backgrounds, both in isolation and also as collaborative efforts that build from past research.</li>
              <li>Trauma <strong>is not</strong> just an individual, personal problem. Here, we must acknowledge that trauma is a system, and <strong>the system itself is the issue</strong>. Systems, including organizations, will create trauma. Because of this, <strong>effective change must also include organizations</strong>.</li>
              <li>Here, know that the trauma these systems create can, and do push people towards negative, self-destructive behaviors as coping mechanisms.</li>

              <li>Accessibility and qualitative research advocate, friend, and trauma-informed design peer Josh Kim tells us that quote, “Trauma is systemic as an interconnected flow between individuals, groups, and societies. We can't address trauma at a societal level unless we address it at an individual level. Conversely, we can't address trauma at an individual level unless we address it at a societal level.” Endquote.</li>

              <li>To that point, know that the origins of harm reduction as a concept and practice have manifested multiple times in multiple ways.
              <li>Of note are the Chicago-based Young Lords, a gang-turned civil and human rights organization active in the 60s and 70s. Their social programs included care treatments and techniques for people who experience substance abuse concerns that are still used today.</li>
              <li>There is also the second wave feminist movement, which pushed for more knowledge and destigmatization of sexual and reproductive health. This includes a core message of bodily autonomy, decriminalization of abortion, and pushing for informed consent in the face of sterilization abuse.</li>
              <li>Activists in the the AIDS crisis are largely responsible for the normalization of needle exchanges.</li>
              <li>And free breakfast and health clinic programs popularized by the Black Panther movement became contemporary public school breakfast and health programs, respectively.</li>
              <li>Each of these movements have a common, unifying thread to acknowledge: A collective response to systems of power that failed, dismissed, or actively sought to eliminate the people they purportedly serve.

              <li>Speaking of acknowledging difficult issues, the concept and practice of trauma-informed design directly stems from harm reduction. It is a design practice that acknowledges the reality of harm and harm reduction strategies, and applies them to physical and digital environments.</li>
              <li>The goal of trauma-informed design is to identify systems that create and inflict harm on the people that exist within them, and then work to holistically update the system to promote safety, resilience, and healing. The core idea with all this being that <strong>any reduction in harm is better than nothing</strong>. And if this is starting to sound like how you think about your job, let me now run this by you:</li>

            <ul>
              <li>Trauma-informed design and disability theory both use various models to help them contextualize their efforts, and that there are massive amounts of overlap for how these models are perceived and used.  Here I’d like to credit Dr. Carol F. Scott, co-Founder of Trauma-Informed Technology, for this insight. Learning about these parallels when interviewing her really helped to unlock this talk.</li>
              <li>For starters, there’s a moral model of addiction and a moral model of disability. Both frame their respective subject matters as personal or familial failings. They also stigmatize the person affected, and media commonly portrays them as villains and monsters, as well as objects of pity.</li>

              <li>Medical models of addiction and disability see the person as someone to be cured. As systems, both are regressive, binary, all-or-nothing affairs. You’re either broken, or you’re airquote fixed.</li>
              <li>Of note here, I’d like to comment on the power dynamics present with both moral and medical models. They are top-down, authoritarian, paternal, and reductionist, in that they implicitly oversimplify and remove the agency of the people affected.</li>

            <ul>
              <li>With the social models, the larger context is taken into consideration. For disability it is the built environment. For addiction, things like cultural norms and socioeconomic status are also factored in.</li>
              <li>These models are both holistic and adaptive, meaning that they are compatible with other theories, methods, and ways of being. The goal of the social models of disability and addiction is to <strong>center, and empower the individual</strong>, and in doing so reduce stigma and harm.</li>
              <li>And that’s what we ultimately want to do as digital accessibility practitioners, right? We want to remove harm, empower, and grant agency to the people who use our services, and do so in a healthy and sustainable way.</li>
              <li>In order to do this, we need to better adapt to, and work within the systems we are placed in.</li>

              <li>Trauma and harm are inevitable outputs of the imperfect systems we exist in. Even in the best-case scenario we need to be better equipped to navigate the difficult realities of digital accessibility work. This compels a trauma-informed, harm reduction mindset, and leads us to my second revelation:</li>

              <li>Tech is a drug. And the people who make it will use.</li>
              <li>The irresistible compulsion to create technology is an inevitability, and it’s a cycle that has been around for as long as there have been humans. And with this compulsion comes the unintentional or deliberate restriction of access to those the tech is distributed to.</li>
              <li>This is combined with a contemporary culture that has near-completely decoupled itself from the ethical principles that should be helping to govern it.</li>
              <li>We need to <strong>understand, accept, and internalize</strong> this, even if we don’t like it. We need to get out of a reactive, audit-based mode of thinking, where we need to wait for harm to be created in order to respond to it.</li>
              <li>This is the Medical and Moral models all over again: Attempting to apply top-down, paternalistic cures to symptoms only after they have been brought to our attention, and then judging the people who manifested those symptoms. </li>
              <li>It also means we are perpetually trapped in anticipation of hurt, and this permanent flinching means we can never unclench.</li>
              <li>Another lesson from trauma-informed design here: We can’t work harder than the system. When it comes to accessibility, we need to be better at meeting our peers where they are and matching the level of work they are willing to do themselves.</li>

              <li>These days, I think about the weekly office hour sessions and Slack channels we monitor a lot like supervised injection sites: The people who show up are going to create tech, but want to do so in a safer way.</li>
              <li>Here, we’re <strong>meeting people where they are</strong>. We’re providing guidance for more accessible approaches, with the hope that they’ll come back until they reach a point where they don’t have to anymore.</li>

              <li>This isn’t a reactive, all-or-nothing affair in the style of the Medical model of disability or addiction. See, we are avoiding needing to demand that technology needs to be completely reworked after it has been put out into the world. We’re not treating only the symptom—instead we’re working within a system’s constraints to find a more effective approach.</li>
              <li>It’s also a framework for us as digital accessibility practitioners to become more comfortable discussing and managing uncomfortable topics and behaviors. This, in turn, helps ourselves, our coworkers, and the audiences we ultimately serve.</li>

              <li>The lack of a visible text label is a lot like the lack of number inputs that allow for quick date entry. In terms of raw usability, these missing inputs objectively make for a better experience. However, it is also a nice-to-have supposing the rest of the designed interactions are accessible and operable.</li>
              <li>For me, this was one of the toughest things to internalize, in that I want what is best for the people we serve.

              <li>The goal here is not to use the session as a way to demonstrate how knowledgeable we are at the expense of alienating someone who came to us for help. <strong>The goal is to reduce harm</strong>, with the ultimate hopes of both eventually removing it, and also equipping others to recognize and avoid it.</li>
              <li>To that point, we must acknowledge the previously described principle and recognize that social inequalities affect people’s vulnerability. The things that we are attuned to as accessibility professionals may have never occurred to the people creating the component, and some of that could be the forces of their lived experience.</li>
              <li>Consider how coding bootcamps relentlessly target what the market demands to make candidates hirable, and how many people who face social inequalities use bootcamps—and the cushy tech job salaries they promise—as an attempt for upwards mobility. Then consider the optics of admitting ignorance on something in a corporate setting, and how age, race, and gender tie into that.</li>

              <li>Granting them the agency to communicate these things allows them to articulate their processes. This gives us insight into the health of the team producing the work. This is good. It leaves teams feeling empowered to have an open dialog, and meets them where they are.</li>
              <li>This means we as accessibility practitioners can then adjust our strategies to adapt to, and more effectively communicate about how they <strong>think about what they produce</strong>. This in turn helps them improve their work, both as individuals and as a team.</li>

              <li>Technology never stops. Because of this, you can’t “win” accessibility.</li>

            <ul>
              <li>“Accessibility is political.” That’s a drumbeat of a message that you’ll hear from Steve Faulkner, Director at TetraLogical and W3C spec editor.</li>
              <li>I think a lot of people think about this quote in terms of remembering the history of <strong>why</strong> we do what we do.</li>

              <li>Resiliency needs to be a community and not a callus.</li>
              <li>Systemic change requires engaging with the forces that govern us in some way other than than enduring things up until we can’t.</li>
              <li>We’ve largely forgotten how to do this, or haven’t even known it was something we could do in the first place. And that’s the trap of the audit-and-remediate-based mindset:</li>
              <li>The labor of a <strong>for-them and not with-us approach</strong>, and the surface-level analysis it compels, distracts us from the deeper structural inquiry and criticism we need in order to not only survive, but also flourish.</li>
