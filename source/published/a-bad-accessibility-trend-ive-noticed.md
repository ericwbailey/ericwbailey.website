A bad accessibility trend I’ve noticed is industries with a lot of gravitas thinking that their use cases are somehow different and special. Somehow, the thinking becomes “our UI component is different because we deal with healthcare/banking/taxes/etc.”

The opposite, however, is true. You want these components to be predictable, to have expected and understandable behavior, and to be as robust as possible.

Weird gimmicks and “activist” interpretations of WCAG will lead to confusion, and confusion will lead to mistakes.

Atypical input for established patterns, misapplying ARIA without testing, citing the WCAG to pressure your personal preference for something with dubious usability are all signs of this sort of misstep.

So, like always, kill your ego, separate yourself from the work, and keep things boring and predictable.
