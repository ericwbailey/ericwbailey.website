I am the original author of the browser extension [Millennials to Snake People](https://addons.mozilla.org/mn/firefox/addon/millennials-to-snake-people/). The code that powers this extension is [public and transparent](https://github.com/ericwbailey/millennials-to-snake-people).

There is another browser extension called “[Snake People 3.0: Slither with a Hiss](https://addons.mozilla.org/mn/firefox/addon/snake-people-3-0/)”. It is made by the highly suspicious [Firefox user 13947499](https://addons.mozilla.org/mn/firefox/user/13947499/).

I do not know who this person is. I am also unable to locate the code they used to make this extension.

The Snake People 3.0 extension may be harmless. It could also be malware. The problem here is without being able to audit its code it is difficult-to-impossible to know.
