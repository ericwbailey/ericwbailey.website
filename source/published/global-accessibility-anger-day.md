For each and every Global Accessibility Awareness Day [(#<abbr>GAAD</abbr>)](https://twitter.com/hashtag/GAAD) post a company puts out today, ask:

- Does the announcement page support basic accessibility considerations (underlined links, captioned videos, valid markup, etc.)?
- Is there a public, written commitment and plan to support their announcement initiatives after GAAD is done?
- Does the announcement use [inspiration porn](https://enabled.in/wp/stella-young-im-not-your-inspiration/) to communicate its message?
- Does the announcement prop up a [disability dongle](https://blog.castac.org/2022/04/disability-dongle/) in an attempt to solutioneer something?
- Does the announcement tout a product that is desined for, and not with disabled people?
- Is that product prohibitively expensive, exclusive, or have no longterm support plan?
- Does the announcement pressure the disclosure of disabled status and experience for one-day social media clout?
- Does the announement have a paternal tone?
- Does the announcement use [ableist language](https://www.autistichoya.com/p/ableist-words-and-terms-to-avoid.html)?
- Does the announcement de-center the disabled experience by trying to communicate in terms of value for all?
- Is there a public, written support from the C-level for the company’s commitment?
- Is there a public, published accessibility statement?
- Has the company partnered with an overlay company?
- Does the company provide material aid for [overlay companies participating in reputation washing](https://adrianroselli.com/2022/09/accessibility-at-the-edge-w3c-cg-is-an-overlay-smoke-screen.html)?
- Are there prematurely closed, downplayed, unaddressed at, or openly ridiculed accessibility issues on their issue tracker?
- Does the company handle pointing out issues with prior negative behavior towards accessibility concerns with tone policing, or in an otherwise defensive or dismissive way?
- Does the company’s DEI efforts include disability?
- Has the company laid off its DEI employees?
- Does the company hire disabled people as permanent, full-time employees?
- And if so, are the full-time roles for anything other than accessibility work?
