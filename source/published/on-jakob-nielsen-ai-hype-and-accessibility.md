A few years ago I made a New Year’s Eve resolution to stop overthinking assholes.

I could delicately, patiently, and painstakingly debunk [the gigantic, misplaced swing](https://web.archive.org/web/20240229233609/https://jakobnielsenphd.substack.com/p/accessibility-generative-ui) of a man who is [burning others' lived experience](https://tink.uk/nielsen-needs-to-think-again/) as fuel to propel his increasingly irrelevant career.

I could also just call him an asshole.
