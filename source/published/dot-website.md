I changed this website’s domain from `.design` to `.website` as part of my redesign. If you subscribe to my RSS feed (and thank you if you do!), [the new URL](https://ericwbailey.website/feed/feed.xml) is:

```html
https://ericwbailey.website/feed/feed.xml
```

Before this website was `.design` it was a `.com`. I’m not a company, and my relationship with design is weird. Updating it to be `.website` feels more accurate.

[Cool URIs don’t change](https://www.w3.org/Provider/Style/URI), but I never claimed to be cool. The redirects I set up should work, but if you find a broken link please let me know.
