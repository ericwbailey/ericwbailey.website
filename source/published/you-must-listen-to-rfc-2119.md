I shared the following message on a Discord server I participate in with some friends:

> having a very normal day where I have to read RFC 3986, as one does

To which a friend quickly replied:

> ‚Ä¶are you having a linking argument? üòÖ

I then demanded to know if they knew what [RFC 3986](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3986) was off the top of their head, to which they replied that the only one they knew by number is [RFC 2119](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2119). This is to say this Discord is full of delightful web nerds.

RFC 2119 establishes language around requirement levels. Terms like ‚ÄúMUST‚Äù, ‚ÄúMUST NOT‚Äù, ‚ÄúSHOULD‚Äù, and ‚ÄúSHOULD NOT‚Äù are helpful when coordinating with engineers. I reference it a lot for work, as I create a lot of [accessible component specifications](https://ericwbailey.website/published/githubs-updated-commits-page-and-the-interactive-list-component/).

Because of this familiarity‚Äîand because I‚Äôm an ass‚ÄîI fired back in Discord:

> I want to hire a voice actor to read 2119 in the most over the top, passive-aggressive way possible
> wait, this is an achievable goal oh no

It turns out you can just pay people to do things.

I found a voice actor and hired them with the task of ‚ÄúReading this very dry technical document in the most over-the-top sarcastic, passive-aggressive, condescending way possible. Like, if you think it's too much, take that feeling, ignore it, and crank things up one more notch.‚Äù

Thank you, [Andrew Winson](https://andrewwinson.com/). You knocked it out of the park and then some:
