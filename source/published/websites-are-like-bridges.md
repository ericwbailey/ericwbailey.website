An incomplete list:

- Most of them are made to make it easier for someone to get to where they want to go.
- Some are purely utilitarian, a few are completely decorative, and most are a combination of both.
- Some are built by governments, some are built by organizations, and some are built by individuals.
- Some are rigorously planned out, while others form more organically.
- Some are built to code, others are not. 
- A few are built by kids, but most are built by adults.
- Some are for general use, and others are private.
- Some are free to use, others require a toll.
- They all require maintenance and upkeep, and that usually requires funding,
- Some of that funding comes from taxes, and some of it does not.
- They can stop working if too many people try to use one all at once.
- They can be shut down for emergency repairs.
- They can also completely collapse if not taken care of properly.
- Some are used nearly around the clock by thousands and thousands of people.
- Others can go days, weeks, or even months before being visited by a single soul.
- Some start out well-trafficked and then fall out of use, others are built up and increase in popularity over time.
- Some of them have billboards, some of them have traffic cameras, and many have both. 
- Some are located nearby, others are far away from where you live. 
- Some feel sturdy and stable, others rickety and unsafe.
- Some sturdy-feeling ones can actually be unsafe, and some rickety-feeling ones can be the secure ones.
- Some safe ones can become dangerous, and some unsafe ones can become more stable.
- Some people are forced to use them, others can take alternate routes.
- Trolls live under a lot of them.

Community suggestions:

- Some are demolished and rebuilt from scratch. h/t [floris](https://freeradical.zone/@floris/111256582413531308).
- A fresh coat of paint can't save the deficiencies of either/ h/t [Jim Nielsen](https://mastodon.social/@jimniels/111257626986137293)
